This open-source project implements a recursive, visual-thinking AGI system using existing tools like GPT-4, Neo4j, and Unity. Based on the 2025 blueprint by Derek Van Derven, it enables modular, ethical cognitive agents with belief graphs, contradiction checks, and simulated visual thought.

Overview
This repository provides a practical developer guide and starter code to build a minimal viable AGI based on the Multimodal Cognitive System blueprint authored by Derek Van Derven (April 2025). It outlines a modular architecture featuring:

Visual thought simulation (textual and optional Unity/Three.js)

Belief graph memory using Neo4j or NetworkX

Contradiction detection and meta-cognitive feedback loops

Goal prioritization and motivation modeling

Recursive, scalable cognitive loops for internal self-reflection

The system is designed to run on standard home PC setups and leverages current open-source tools and language models like GPT-4, Claude, or open LLMs.

Getting Started

Minimal Viable Cognitive Loop (MVCL)


Thought Generation: Use an LLM to interpret inputs and generate symbolic internal thoughts.

Belief Graph Memory: Store and manage beliefs as graph nodes and edges with metadata like confidence, timestamps, and contradictions.

Contradiction Detection: Identify conflicts using symbolic logic or LLM reasoning and update belief confidence.

Visual Thought Simulation: Optionally generate textual or visual scene representations.

Meta-Cognitive Reflection: Trigger updates based on detected contradictions or uncertainties.

Goal Prioritization: Simulate motivation using a stack or JSON-based rules.


Tech Stack
LLM: OpenAI GPT-4, Claude, Mistral, or local LLMs

Graph Memory: Neo4j or NetworkX (Python)

Logic & Contradiction: Python scripts, Prolog, or LLM-based reasoning prompts

Visual Simulation: Unity, Three.js, or text-to-image models (Stable Diffusion)

Integration: Python, LangChain, or custom CLI/GUI


Usage
Clone the repo

Run the starter scripts to initialize belief graphs and contradiction modules

Follow the integration guide to build modular cognitive loops

Expand with visual simulation or motivational layers as needed
