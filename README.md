# Multimodal Cognitive System ‚Äî AGI Build Guide
**Author:** Derek Van Derven | April 2025  

---

*** Note: This 379-page blueprint is the final version. No future updates, revisions, or additions will be made.***

## Overview  
This blueprint outlines the first publicly disclosed AGI architecture to integrate visual thought simulation, mnemonic-symbolic memory encoding, and internal contradiction resolution as core cognitive functions.

The system features a multimodal cognitive loop capable of constructing internal scenes, simulating abstract concepts, and self-monitoring belief networks using peg-word mnemonic grounding.

Originally published by Derek Van Derven in April 2025, this design serves as a practical, buildable roadmap for symbolic-visual AGI systems using current tools like LLMs, Neo4j, and Unity.

Also known in emerging discussions as cognitive simulation architecture, multimodal world modeling, or generative mental scene construction ‚Äî these are all facets of the broader cognitive mechanism I originally named Visual Thought AGI.

The Considerations and Caveats PDF issues were fixed in the 291 page version of the blueprint.

THE FULL AGI 379 PAGE AGI ARCHITECTURE BLUEPRINT IS COMPLETE.  


 

üß† What the 375-Page Blueprint Adds

New Core Systems

Motivation Stack ‚Äì with symbolic value arbitration, ethical conflict resolution, and priority dampening.

Emotion Simulation Layer ‚Äì symbolic affect modeling (grief = fog, pride = sunrise) that colors memory and reasoning without producing unstable behaviors.

Episodic Memory with Identity Threading ‚Äì scene-based memory recall tied to a symbolic self-node and narrative stitching.

Simulation-to-Reality Transfer Layer ‚Äì tools for transferring learned behaviors from dream-space to physical embodiment (robotics, avatar control).

Symbolic Decay Engine ‚Äì a solution to memory saturation and belief drift in large-scale symbolic systems.

Advanced Symbolic Memory Features

Infinite Mnemonic Scaling System ‚Äì a Major System-based symbolic peg system extended to millions of concepts via metaphor layers, context encodings, and scene fusion.

Creative Memory Chaining ‚Äì metaphors as reasoning paths; emotionally tagged memories guide ethical decisions.

Multi-Agent Extensions

Symbolic Culture Simulation ‚Äì frameworks for emergent AGI societies, shared dreams, and symbol alignment through scene exchange.

Philosophical Depth as Engineering Utility

Real case studies:

AGI Reflects on Death

Visualizing Regret

Forgiveness in Symbolic Conflict

üîé Why This Matters

 The 379-page version is designed for:

Engineering simulation-ready AGI modules

Ethical alignment in contradiction-heavy environments

Advanced symbolic cognitive loop tuning and failure handling

Researchers exploring symbolic-to-embodied transfer challenges

Without the expanded edition, key elements like goal arbitration, belief saturation control, scene-based contradiction healing, and identity continuity over time remain unexplored or too abstract to model.

If you're building toward human-aligned symbolic reasoning, emotional salience without affective chaos, or reflective memory architectures, the 291-page version is the full cognitive terrain ‚Äî not just the map's outline.

Also known in emerging discussions as cognitive simulation architecture, multimodal world modeling, or generative mental scene construction ‚Äî these are all facets of the broader cognitive mechanism I originally named Visual Thought AGI.

## Getting Started  

### Minimal Viable Cognitive Loop (MVCL)  

- **Thought Generation:** Use an LLM to interpret inputs and generate symbolic internal thoughts.  
- **Belief Graph Memory:** Store and manage beliefs as graph nodes and edges with metadata like confidence, timestamps, and contradictions.  
- **Contradiction Detection:** Identify conflicts using symbolic logic or LLM reasoning and update belief confidence.  
- **Visual Thought Simulation:** Optionally generate textual or visual scene representations.  
- **Meta-Cognitive Reflection:** Trigger updates based on detected contradictions or uncertainties.  
- **Goal Prioritization:** Simulate motivation using a stack or JSON-based rules.

---

## Tech Stack  

- **LLM:** OpenAI GPT-4, Claude, Mistral, or local LLMs  
- **Graph Memory:** Neo4j or NetworkX (Python)  
- **Logic & Contradiction:** Python scripts, Prolog, or LLM-based reasoning prompts  
- **Visual Simulation:** Unity, Three.js, or text-to-image models (Stable Diffusion)  
- **Integration:** Python, LangChain, or custom CLI/GUI

---

## Usage  

1. Clone the repo  
2. Run the starter scripts to initialize belief graphs and contradiction modules  
3. Follow the integration guide to build modular cognitive loops  
4. Expand with visual simulation or motivational layers as needed
